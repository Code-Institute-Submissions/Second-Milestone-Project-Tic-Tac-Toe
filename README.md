# Tic Tac Toe

## Idea behind the game
I always enjoyed playing tic tac toe but I was always losing against my older sisters so I have decided I will make this game as my project, including rules and tips to win to help those people or younger siblings to be able to enjoy and win this simple but all time favorite game. I wanted to have a great simple and clear design which has all the functions, make the game decorative. Also included a small song that I saw on a  TV show. The song is funny and can put a smile on the player’s face, and for sure it will stack in their head for a few days. 

## Who is it for?

I am sure there are only a few people who have never played tic tac toe in their life, it doesn’t matter if it was on paper, against friends, siblings or the computer, one is for sure this is a fun and simple game. 
So the answer is it is for everyone. Beginners, experts, it doesn't matter. 
Beginners or people who have never played the game:
There is a small history modal in the page, which shows how far this great game goes back.
The other modal I created is a rules tab, which gives the basic rules and some good tips on how to win against our game partner. 

## User Experience

Clear design of the and easy to navigate on the site
Simple rules of the game for every age category 
Clear scoring system and timing 
Rematching and taking turns who starts the game 
Able to switch between light or dark background 
Able to reload the page for new players without using the  browser’s reload page button 
Able to mute the game if the user prefers to not have sounds 
Stop and pause tic-tac-toe song 
On closing tic tac toe song modal the song stops and resets for the beginning
Accessible and responsive on every screen size


## Wireframe 

The design from the very beginning started with a simple red black and white as tic tac toe often played on a white paper drawn by plack pan and crossed over with red marker. The following moodboard and wireframes were created for the project. The game didn’t change through the process, the only feature i didn’t implement is the hover over effect on the empty grids, but in the end added a score section and a countdown timer to the game.

### Navbar:

The navbar is stuck to the top of the page and it includes 3 tabs that toggle on the smaller screen to the hamburger button. Rules modal, history modal and a fun song for those who would like to take a little break during the game. The navigation bar expands at large screen size from hamburger button to 3 visible tabs. 
In the event of switching background color from light to dark, the navbar changes its color from black to white and the font color is changing accordingly.

## The main section and play area

### Opening page:
The game opens with a full page cover modal, the modal has a form inside, which is asking the players to submit their names. If the value of the player’s name is empty it comes up with the error message the player's name is required, or if the name is greater than 6 letter it also pops up with an error message saying the player’s name is max 6 characters. On submission, the timer starts and the game begins.

### Mute button:
It gives the choice for the user to be able to mute and clear all sounds during the gaem, if mute button on the tic tac toe song is not playing either. The user can easily switch between mute and sound by clicking the button, which changes its icon accordingly.

### Next turn:
The next turn on the top of the page , under the navbar is shows, who’s turn is next, who is the one able to draw on the grid. The next turn section is displaying the user’s name instead of just displaying the “X” or the “O” turns.

### Light and Dark mode:
A switch button is found on the right top corner of the page, and the background color can be switched one to and other either a white otr a black background. The switch also changes the “X” colour but the “O” stays red on the event of switch.

### Score and timer:
The timer is place above the score section and it counts back from 60sec “1:0” minutes and if no draw or win was achieved by the end of this time, a message is displayed, No Winner and on the top of the score section a “the time is up” message is displayed. The pop up modal gives an option to the players to rematch or start a new game with new users. In the event of a rematch the timer starts again and counts back from 60 second.
Below the countdown is the scoring section which shows each player’s number of winning rounds.

### Game grid are:
This is the actual game area and displays an “X” or an “O” according to the player;s turn. It has nine cells and whoever reaches the 3 in a row of their symbol either horizontally, vertically or diagonally becomes the winner of the game, that is awarded with a congratulation message on a pop up modal and with a small winner sound played. Their score is added to the board and the players can decide if they would like to play a rematch or they would like to swap with another player, and reload the page by the new players button. 
In the event of a draw, a message comes up on the screen and again gives the options to the players to decide on a rematch or they would like to start a new game with new players. A draw sound is also played on the moment of the draw announcement. 
If the players couldn’t get a win or a draw within 60 second the time is up and the same options apply again in the modal as a new game or a rematch. The rematch is changing turns of the players, as often said most like those who start the game, win the game. In this case everyone has the same chance.

## Issues and bugs 


### Navbar toggle button:
The toggle button was not opening the navbar. There was an additional class in the navigation which was causing the issue, and after removing the extra class the toggle waqs opening and closing again. First I thought it was the broken Youtube link which i first place was planning to use in the song modal. 


### Bootstrap Modal:
First I used the new Bootstrap beta 5 version in the html script for the modal JS and jQuery and that caused some issues with displaying Bootstrap modal. After changing the link to the Bootstrap 4.5.3 version, the code and modal was working as it should. 

### Background color balck:
When I changed the background color white, one of the X’s half disappeared. Quickly I figured out why it is not changing back to black color. I added the “body.black::before” before the actual style and then added the “body.black::after” after the original style and that fixed the bug. 

### Opening page:
Had some issues getting started on the opening page, as after the submission of the players,the button was not closing for the first click but for the second. I tried jQuery hide and also adding a css visibility hidden to the page, but in the end I had to swap the original “container” to a modal and that solved the issue and the opening page was closing on the first click. 

### Xand O winner:
X and O winners were not announced in an order and function to display the winning message or the tie was not functioning properly. It was displaying the message randomly, or not at all. I figured that inside the handleclick the the checkWinner if and else if statement was written before the drawClick element so it couldn’t be executed. Changed the order and the code was immediately working. 

### Countdown:
The countdown function was not stopping at the announcement of the winner or at the event of draw, and even after rematching it was not set back to 60second. The function was created to the countdown clock, but the set interval was inside the function. I tried to display it with the innerText on the event of submitting the player’s name but it was still not working. In the end the set Interval needed to go to the submit function and innerText was not needed. 

### Rematch displaying Game over, no winner when time is up:
When the whole site was functioning and all codes were executed the last thing was the rematch to display the modal when the time was up and no winner or tie was achieved. The rematch onclick had the setInterval with the countdown function and resetting the milliseconds for 1000 but the time was rushing by double seconds and the end modal was not displaying. In the end I figured, it needed to add a clearInterval to the onclick function so that fixed the double seconds. Later I added a jQuery show to the countdown function if statement as well as an add class show and then the 2 together made the rematch function to display the game over modal in the end of the 60 second. 

## Testing 

To validate my code I used W3C for CSS and jsonformatter validator for HTML, and jshint.com for JavaScript validation.

![JavaScript validation](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbwtdwgnt/image/upload/v1612265613/Screenshot_2021-02-02_at_10.19.10_wpsj8s.png)


The site was tested all the way through, using Chrome dev tools, and made sure each section displays well in different device sizes. Also regularly run through Lighthouse both on Mobile and Desktop testing. My friends were helping testing it on Android devices and I was using a Macbook, iPhone and iPad to test the game regularly.
My code was also beautified and validated for all html, css and JavaScript in the above mentioned sites.

For a very basic idea of the tic tac toe game I watched the following video. I help me have something in mind and gave me some inspiration for the rough look of the game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GkMjUZsmM)

For the audio sounds of winning and tie i used sounds from the [following website](https://freesound.org/search/?q=alarm&s=duration+asc&g=1&advanced=0&f=&page=3#sound)

To convert the youtube video to mp3 I used the [following website](https://youtubetomp3music.com/en5/)
